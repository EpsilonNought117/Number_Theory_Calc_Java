# Number_Theory_Calc_Java
This is a Number Theory Calculator made in Java.

It contains files for the methods - 

1. GCD
2. Linear Diophantine Equations
3. Linear Congruence
4. Factorization
5. Euler Totient Function
6. Strong-Form Chinese Remainder Theorem

To use just run the NT_Calc.java file in terminal.
Don't run the Func.java file, it doesn nothing, it is mainly for parsing, checking and other useful functions required for error handling and all.
Yet to add comments.

Edit 1: Fixed an issue in CRT where 0 wouldn't be accepted as an input for resiude, also fixed an issue for CRT, LDE and LC where the program exits if no solution exists to the user input.
Edit 2: Fixed an Issue in FC where it won't return the factors of 1.
Thank You for Using this!! :)
